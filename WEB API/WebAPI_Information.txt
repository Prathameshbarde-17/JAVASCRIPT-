A Web API is a developer's dream.

It can extend the functionality of the browser
It can greatly simplify complex functions
It can provide easy syntax to complex code

What is Web API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.

A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.

A Browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser.

A Server API can extend the functionality of a web server.

The most important APIs in HTML/JavaScript development are.

The DOM API for HTML and XML documents
The Fetch API for networking
The Web Storage API for client-side data
These APIs are fundamental to nearly all modern web development.

The DOM API
The DOM (Document Object Model) is the core API for HTML and XML documents. It provides a structured representation of a webpage, allowing JavaScript to access and manipulate elements, attributes, and content dynamically, creating interactive user interfaces.

The Fetch API
The modern standard for making network requests to servers and retrieving resources (like data from a database or a third-party service). It provides a more robust and flexible alternative to older methods like XMLHttpRequest.

Web Storage API
Offers mechanisms (localStorage and sessionStorage) to store key/value pairs of data in the browser more intuitively than cookies, allowing data to persist across sessions or page reloads.

Third Party APIs
Third party APIs are not built into your browser.

To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web.

Examples:

YouTube API - Allows you to display videos on a web site.
Twitter API - Allows you to display Tweets on a web site.
Facebook API - Allows you to display Facebook info on a web site.
